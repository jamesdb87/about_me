      <h3>A little overview of my mind</h3>
        <p>My professional and educational history have taken me 
        down several roads. I earned a Bachelor's degree in 
        Exercise Science with the intention of going to phsyical 
        therapy school. That didn't feel right, so I've been doing 
        tech support for several years for MasteryConnect, and then 
        Canvas. I've attempted to learn how to write code for 
        several years, and finally decided I needed an official, 
        structured environment that a bootcamp would provide.

      <h3>A little overview of my heart</h3>
        <p>I have dedicated the last several months to creating a light art installation which you can see <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/yiK4WcWFmafRS47TA">here.</a> One of my goals for this bootcamp is to create a compelling website to publicize my art (obviously I have a long way to go). As a tangent to that goal, I hope to become proficient at programming LED lights.</p>
